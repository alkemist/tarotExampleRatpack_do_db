# Ratpack Tarot App - NO DB

A simple Groovy/Ratpack application WITHOUT database access.

The "meanings" are read from a local text file.

It was created as a learning and proof-of-concept project for BOTH Groovy and Ratpack, and is not expected to be beautiful by any means.

This version uses old-style HTML (pre-HTML 5), with a smidgeon of JQuery to show how to use JQuery in the Ratpack template engine.

This is just the beginning!

NOTE:

This is based upon several resources I discovered on the internet.
I will add resource links links when I update the project.
